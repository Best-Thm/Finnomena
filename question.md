### > How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
I use around 4 day to code the test. I would like to add search function to be able to find specific fund info by using fund's name and decorate the application to be more friendly to user.

### > What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
I think the most useful feature is flutter_lints. It is an analysis package to improve code performance by suggesting to write code cleaner and save more memory.

### > How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
I have never track down applicaion performance before. But, I have done some performance test on website by using Postman to run API collection to find amount of time that application used.

### > How would you improve the FINNOMENA APIs that you just used?
I would send params along with the APIs to backend,so it can compute what frontend need ,such as filtering data with time range, to reduce the burden on frontend.
Example: http://api.../filter?range=4D
